Importance in the district economy

The basic travel and tourism industries accounted for 3.5 percent of
total employment in the Tenth District in 2000, basically the same
share as in the nation (Chart 2).12 Likewise, estimates from the TIA
show that travel expenditures in Tenth District states in 1999 were
equivalent to 5.5 percent of total output in the region, also quite similar
to the nation. This similarity in travel and tourism’s importance has persisted
over time, with the industry’s share of economic activity rising
approximately 40 percent from the early 1980s to the late 1990s in
both the nation and the district.
While travel and tourism’s importance to the Tenth District as a
whole resembles that of the nation, the industry’s role in most individual
district states is far from average. The district’s three Rocky Mountain
states—Colorado, New Mexico, and Wyoming—are among the top ten
states in the country in terms of their concentration of employment in
the basic travel and tourism industries. Travel and tourism is considerably
less important in the Plains region of the district. Kansas, Nebraska, and
Oklahoma rank among the bottom ten states in concentration of basic
travel and tourism jobs, and Missouri’s share of such jobs is also slightly
below the national average.13 Despite these differences across states, the
industry’s importance has grown in all seven district states in recent
decades. From the early 1980s to the late 1990s, the basic travel and
tourism industries’ share of gross state product grew about 20 percent in
Colorado and Missouri, roughly 50 percent in Kansas, Nebraska, New
Mexico, and Oklahoma, and over 80 percent in Wyoming. 
A map of travel and tourism’s employment share in Tenth District
counties shows that the highest concentrations are indeed in the mountain
states, particularly in northwestern Wyoming, western Colorado,
and northern New Mexico (Figure 1). Recent visitor statistics show that
several national parks and ski resorts in these states are among the most
popular in the country (Table 1). Recent rankings from travel magazines
also show that some Rocky Mountain destinations—most notably Yellowstone
National Park, several Colorado ski areas, and Santa Fe, New
Mexico—are among their readers’ favorite vacation spots.14
