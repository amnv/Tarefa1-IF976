The Deadliest TsunamisThe biggest Tsunamis in modern history
Tsunamis are one of the most destructive events triggered by Mother Nature. Tsunami wave trains can move as fast as an airplane in high seas. These extremely powerful tidal waves are capable of crushing everything found in their path. The deadliest tsunamis have formed in response to powerful seaquakes, underwater explosions and volcanic eruptions. Here is a list of the most destructive tsunamis ever recorded in modern times:
Sendai, Japan 2011: Japan and other countries Maule, Chile 2010: Chile and other countries Sumatra, Indonesia 2004: Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Maldives and other countries Valdivia, Chile 1960: Chile, Hawaii, Japan, Philippines and other countries Lisbon, Portugal 1755: Portugal, Spain, Marocco, North Africa and other countries Other Destructive Tsunamis in the last 10 years
Differently from what the general public think, destructive tsunamis are not unusual as they occur at a frequency of almost one per year. Although the impact of a destructive tsunami may vary sensibly on local populations so that mass media cover the biggest events only, local Tsunamis may still cause wide spread damage in the areas where they strike.
Here is a report on other "minor" deadly tsunamis occurred in the last 10 years:
Apr 01, 2014: Iquique, Chile
A mighty 8.2-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of northern Chile triggering small landslides, cutting power and generating a tsunami. Four men and one woman died - two who suffered heart attacks and three who were crushed. The quake struck about 8:46 p.m. local time, some 60 miles northwest of Iquique. It had a depth of 12.5 miles. Tsunami waves of more than 6 feet generated by the earthquake washed ashore on the coast of Pisagua. Iquique, with a population of more than 200,000, saw 7-foot waves.
Feb 06, 2013: Lata, Solomon Islands
A powerful M8.0 Earthquake hit off the coast of the pacific ocean's Solomon Islands archipelago triggering a local Tsunami that traveled for about a thousand miles before losing its energy. Dozens people were injured on the islands and at least 13 people were killed. Loss of life and property damage mostly affected Solomon Islands and the neighboring Vanuatu.
Oct 25, 2010: Sumatra, Indonesia
A 7.2 Earthquake off the Coast of the island of Sumatra, Indonesia, unleashed a regional Tsunami that killed at least 509 people while another 21 went missing.
Jan 4, 2010: Solomon Islands
In January 2010 the western part of the Solomon Islands were hit by a Tsunami wave train that followed two powerful earthquakes measuring 6.5 and 7.2 on the Richter scale. These two major shakes were followed by a number of smaller quakes and all together the quakes triggered waves that left about 1,000 homeless.
Sep 29, 2009: Samoa Island and American Samoa
A powerful 8.0-magnitude earthquake off the coast of Samoa triggered Tsunami waves that hit mostly the Pacific island nation of Samoa and American Samoa. At least 184 people were killed on the islands.
April 2, 2007: Solomon Islands
A regional Tsunami triggered by a magnitude-8.0 earthquake caused the death of more than 50 people and injuries to hundreds of people. Thousands of homes were destroyed and people were relocated to safe areas on the island.
July 17, 2006: Island of Java, Indonesia
At least 668 people were killed due to a Tsunami triggered by a magnitude-6.8 earthquake with epicenter off the coast of Indonesia's West Java. Apart from the casualties, at least 1,438 people were injured and about 74,000 people lost their homes.
June, 2001, Peru
A magnitude-8.4 earthquake in southern Peru was followed by a major Tsunami that took the life of at least 78 people and caused wide spread damages estimated in about $300 million.
