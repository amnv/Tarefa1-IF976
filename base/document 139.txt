Minnesota tourism could be stung by 'Trump slump'

Travel industry experts are predicting a significant drop in overseas tourism to the United States this year, and state officials worry that Minnesota could absorb at least some of that hit.

WCCO reports on the worries of a "Trump slump" for the tourism sector, as foreign travelers recoil from the Trump Administration's policies on visas and immigration. Airfare searches to the U.S. on the website Hopper have declined in 102 of 122 countries since Trump's inauguration, including more than 46 percent from China and 32 percent from Ireland.

A decline in international travel could be felt statewide in Minnesota, but particularly by places such as the Mall of America, which markets itself internationally. The Star Tribune in 2014 reported that about 50,000 Chinese tourists visit the mall each year.

John Edman, director of Explore Minnesota, said it's too early to see an effect on Minnesota from any broader decline, but he says tourism companies should clearly communicate issues over visas and other policies with travelers.
