Tsunami

Add profiles for those who have DIED in or as a result of injuries from in a Tsunami.

If the Tsunami is a well-known historic event, please consider making a project for it, and listing it in this umbrella. (ie Dec 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami; include mo/yr of tsunami in title of project)
If all you know is "died in a tsnuami," add to this project.
Use discussions to ask questions, make comments, etc.
A tsunami is a series of water waves caused by the displacement of a large volume of a body of water, typically an ocean or a large lake. Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and other underwater explosions (including detonations of underwater nuclear devices), landslides, glacier calvings, meteorite impacts and other disturbances above or below water all have the potential to generate a tsunami.

Tsunami waves do not resemble normal sea waves, because their wavelength is far longer. Rather than appearing as a breaking wave, a tsunami may instead initially resemble a rapidly rising tide, and for this reason they are often referred to as tidal waves. Tsunamis generally consist of a series of waves with periods ranging from minutes to hours, arriving in a so-called “wave train”. Wave heights of tens of meters can be generated by large events. Although the impact of tsunamis is limited to coastal areas, their destructive power can be enormous and they can affect entire ocean basins; the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was among the deadliest natural disasters in human history with over 230,000 people killed in 14 countries bordering the Indian Ocean.

Some interesting Facts:

1.	About 80% of tsunamis happen within the Pacific Ocean’s “Ring of Fire.”
2.	The first wave of a tsunami is usually not the strongest, successive waves get bigger and stronger.
3.	Tsunamis can travel at speeds of about 500 miles or 805 kilometers an hour, almost as fast as a jet plane.
4.	The states in the U.S. at greatest risk for tsunamis are Hawaii, Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and California.
