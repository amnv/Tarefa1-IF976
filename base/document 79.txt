Tsunamis generated by an earthquake in Chile have struck French Polynesia, but there are no reports of major damage or casualties.

Huge waves struck the Gambier archipelago at 6:30am (local time), the high commissioner's office in Papeete said, as the tsunami raced across the Pacific.

The Marquesas Islands, north-east of Polynesia, were hit between 7.00-8.00am (local time) by a series of two-metre waves which damaged some boats but no-one was hurt.

A four-metre wave also hit Hiva Oa in the Marquesas.

Schools across the region were closed, the port in Papeete was evacuated and thousands in Tahiti's hillside areas were transported from their homes to safer areas.

However, many residents along the coast refused to leave, fearing lootings.

The high commissioner advised people living on low-lying areas to move to regions at least 10 metres above sea level in the Marquesas, the eastern coast of Tahiti and Rurutu.

Between the waves the sea withdrew about 15 metres, causing rip currents.

Sirens wailed in French Polynesia and PA systems woke up residents to alert them of the impending waves.

The high commissioner's office in Papeete put the islands on alert at 2:00am (local time).

A flight run by Air Tahiti Nui, due to arrive in Tahiti, was diverted to Hawaii.

In Tahiti all traffic was banned within 500 metres of the coast.

Tsunamis generally come in several waves of which the first may not be the highest.

A huge arc of Pacific nations from New Zealand to Japan went on tsunami alert following the 8.8 magnitude Chilean earthquake, readying emergency plans instituted after the Indian Ocean disaster of 2004.
