Nuclear power plants[edit]
Further information: Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster
The Fukushima Daiichi, Fukushima Daini, Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant and Tōkai nuclear power stations, consisting of a total eleven reactors, were automatically shut down following the earthquake.[265] Higashidōri, also on the northeast coast, was already shut down for a periodic inspection. Cooling is needed to remove decay heat after a Generation II reactor has been shut down, and to maintain spent fuel pools. The backup cooling process is powered by emergency diesel generators at the plants and at Rokkasho nuclear reprocessing plant.[266] At Fukushima Daiichi and Daini, tsunami waves overtopped seawalls and destroyed diesel backup power systems, leading to severe problems at Fukushima Daiichi, including three large explosions and radioactive leakage. Subsequent analysis found that many Japanese nuclear plants, including Fukushima Daiichi, were not adequately protected against tsunami.[267] Over 200,000 people were evacuated.[268]
7 April aftershock caused the loss of external power to Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant and Higashidori Nuclear Power Plant but backup generators were functional. Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant lost 3 of 4 external power lines and temporarily lost cooling function in its spent fuel pools for "20 to 80 minutes". A spill of "up to 3.8 litres" of radioactive water also occurred at Onagawa following the aftershock.[269]
A report by the IAEA in 2012 found that the Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant, the closest nuclear plant to the epicenter of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, had remained largely undamaged. The plant's 3 reactors automatically shut down without damage and all safety systems functioned as designed. The plant's 14-metre-high (46 ft) seawall successfully withstood the tsunami.[270]
Europe's Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger addressed the European Parliament on 15 March, explaining that the nuclear disaster was an "apocalypse".[271] As the nuclear crisis entered a second month, experts recognized that Fukushima Daiichi is not the worst nuclear accident ever, but it is the most complicated. Nuclear experts stated that Fukushima will go down in history as the second-worst nuclear accident ever.... while not as bad as Chernobyl disaster, worse than Three Mile Island accident. It could take months or years to learn how damaging the release of dangerous isotopes has been to human health and food supplies, and the surrounding countryside.[272]
Later analysis indicated three reactors at Fukushima I (Units 1, 2, and 3) had suffered meltdowns and continued to leak coolant water,[45] and by summer the Vice-minister for Economy, Trade and Industry, the head of the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, and the head of the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy, had lost their jobs.[273]

Loose livestock roam the evacuation zone
Japan declared a state of emergency following the failure of the cooling system at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, resulting in the evacuation of nearby residents.[274][275][276] Officials from the Japanese Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency reported that radiation levels inside the plant were up to 1,000 times normal levels,[277] and that radiation levels outside the plant were up to 8 times normal levels.[278] Later, a state of emergency was also declared at the Fukushima Daini nuclear power plant about 11 km (6.8 mi) south.[279] This brought the total number of problematic reactors to six.[280]
It was reported that radioactive iodine was detected in the tap water in Fukushima, Tochigi, Gunma, Tokyo, Chiba, Saitama, and Niigata, and radioactive cesium in the tap water in Fukushima, Tochigi and Gunma.[281][282][283] Radioactive cesium, iodine, and strontium[284] were also detected in the soil in some places in Fukushima. There may be a need to replace the contaminated soil.[285] Many radioactive hotspots were found outside the evacuation zone, including Tokyo.[286] Food products were also found contaminated by radioactive matter in several places in Japan.[287] On 5 April 2011, the government of the Ibaraki Prefecture banned the fishing of sand lance after discovering that this species was contaminated by radioactive cesium above legal limits.[288] As late as July 2013 slightly elevated levels of radioactivity were found in beef on sale at Tokyo markets.[289]
Incidents elsewhere[edit]
A fire occurred in the turbine section of the Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant following the earthquake.[266][290] The blaze was in a building housing the turbine, which is sited separately from the plant's reactor,[274] and was soon extinguished.[291] The plant was shut down as a precaution.[292]
On 13 March the lowest-level state of emergency was declared regarding the Onagawa plant as radioactivity readings temporarily[293] exceeded allowed levels in the area of the plant.[294][295] Tōhoku Electric Power Co. stated this may have been due to radiation from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accidents but was not from the Onagawa plant itself.[296]
As a result of 7 April aftershock, Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant lost 3 of 4 external power lines and lost cooling function for as much as 80 minutes. A spill of a couple of litres of radioactive water occurred at Onagawa.[269]
The number 2 reactor at Tōkai Nuclear Power Plant was shut down automatically.[265] On 14 March it was reported that a cooling system pump for this reactor had stopped working;[297] however, the Japan Atomic Power Company stated that there was a second operational pump sustaining the cooling systems, but that two of three diesel generators used to power the cooling system were out of order.[298]
Wind power[edit]
None of Japan's commercial wind turbines, totaling over 2300 MW in nameplate capacity, failed as a result of the earthquake and tsunami, including the Kamisu offshore wind farm directly hit by the tsunami.[299]
Transport[edit]

A highway bridge damaged and severed
Japan's transport network suffered severe disruptions. Many sections of Tōhoku Expressway serving northern Japan were damaged. The expressway did not reopen to general public use until 24 March 2011.[300][301] All railway services were suspended in Tokyo, with an estimated 20,000 people stranded at major stations across the city.[302] In the hours after the earthquake, some train services were resumed.[303] Most Tokyo area train lines resumed full service by the next day—12 March.[304] Twenty thousand stranded visitors spent the night of 11–12 March inside Tokyo Disneyland.[305]
A tsunami wave flooded Sendai Airport at 15:55 JST,[120] about 1 hour after the initial quake, causing severe damage. Narita and Haneda Airport both briefly suspended operations after the quake, but suffered little damage and reopened within 24 hours.[235] Eleven airliners bound for Narita were diverted to nearby Yokota Air Base.[306][307]

Remains of Shinchi Station
Various train services around Japan were also canceled, with JR East suspending all services for the rest of the day.[308] Four trains on coastal lines were reported as being out of contact with operators; one, a four-car train on the Senseki Line, was found to have derailed, and its occupants were rescued shortly after 8 am the next morning.[309] Minami-Kesennuma Station on the Kesennuma Line was obliterated save for its platform;[310] 62 of 70 (31 of 35) JR East train lines suffered damage to some degree;[231] in the worst-hit areas, 23 stations on 7 lines were washed away, with damage or loss of track in 680 locations and the 30-km radius around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant unable to be assessed.[311]
There were no derailments of Shinkansen bullet train services in and out of Tokyo, but their services were also suspended.[235] The Tōkaidō Shinkansen resumed limited service late in the day and was back to its normal schedule by the next day, while the Jōetsu and Nagano Shinkansen resumed services late on 12 March. Services on Yamagata Shinkansen resumed with limited numbers of trains on 31 March.[312]
Derailments were minimized because of an early warning system that detected the earthquake before it struck. The system automatically stopped all high-speed trains, which minimized the damage.[313]
The Tōhoku Shinkansen line was worst hit, with JR East estimating that 1,100 sections of the line, varying from collapsed station roofs to bent power pylons, will need repairs. Services on the Tōhoku Shinkansen partially resumed only in Kantō area on 15 March, with one round-trip service per hour between Tokyo and Nasu-Shiobara,[314] and Tōhoku area service partially resumed on 22 March between Morioka and Shin-Aomori.[315] Services on Akita Shinkansen resumed with limited numbers of trains on 18 March.[316] Service between Tokyo and Shin-Aomori was restored by May, but at lower speeds due to ongoing restoration work; the pre-earthquake timetable was not reinstated until late September.[317]

Train washed away uphill from Onagawa Station
The rolling blackouts brought on by the crises at the nuclear power plants in Fukushima had a profound effect on the rail networks around Tokyo starting on 14 March. Major railways began running trains at 10–20 minute intervals, rather than the usual 3–5 minute intervals, operating some lines only at rush hour and completely shutting down others; notably, the Tōkaidō Main Line, Yokosuka Line, Sōbu Main Line and Chūō-Sōbu Line were all stopped for the day.[318] This led to near-paralysis within the capital, with long lines at train stations and many people unable to come to work or get home. Railway operators gradually increased capacity over the next few days, until running at approximately 80% capacity by 17 March and relieving the worst of the passenger congestion.
Telecommunications[edit]

Damaged utility pole in Ishinomaki
Cellular and landline phone service suffered major disruptions in the affected area.[319] Immediately after the earthquake cellular communication was jammed across much of Japan due to a surge of network activity. On the day of the quake, American broadcaster NPR was unable to reach anyone in Sendai with working phone or Internet.[320] Internet services were largely unaffected in areas where basic infrastructure remained, despite the earthquake having damaged portions of several undersea cable systems landing in the affected regions; these systems were able to reroute around affected segments onto redundant links.[321][322] Within Japan, only a few websites were initially unreachable.[323] Several Wi-Fi hotspot providers reacted to the quake by providing free access to their networks,[323] and some American telecommunications and VoIP companies such as AT&T, Sprint, Verizon,[324] T-Mobile[325] and VoIP companies such as netTALK[326] and Vonage[327] have offered free calls to (and in some cases, from) Japan for a limited time, as did Germany's Deutsche Telekom.[328]
