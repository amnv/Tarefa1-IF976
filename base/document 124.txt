Impact of Travel and Tourism on the U.S. Economy 

The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) measures travel and tourism across two dozen industry
categories based on a system known as Travel and Tourism Satellite Accounts.Widely cited BEA
data tend to exaggerate the size of the travel and tourism sector by emphasizing the sector’s
output, which was $728 billion in 2013 based on preliminary data.16 In general, the size and
importance of various economic sectors are best judged by their value added, which includes
employee compensation and taxes as well as profit. Tourism industries had $415 billion in value
added in 2011, accounting for 2.8% of U.S. GDP (see Table 1). 17 Domestic travelers were
responsible for about 80% of this activity.18
Output, which represents total sales related to travel and tourism, came to $900 billion in 2013.
After adjusting for inflation, BEA estimates that tourism output rose 3.6% in 2013, the fourth
consecutive year of growth following steep declines in 2008 and 2009.19 Even so, BEA estimates, 
tourism output in 2013 was about 2% lower than in the peak year of 2007, after adjusting for
inflation.20 This finding mirrors other data. For instance, 646 million passengers boarded
domestic commercial flights in 2013, 5% below the 2007 peak of 679 million.21
A particular economic attraction of tourism is that it enables state and local governments to
generate significant amounts of revenue without taxing their own citizens. Taxes on hotel rooms,
automobile rentals, and admission tickets fall heavily on visitors. Annual collections of such taxes
cannot be determined; according to the Census Bureau, selective sales taxes, including taxes on
hotel rooms and rental cars as well as on certain nontourist items, generated $66 billion in 2011,
amounting to 5% of state and local governments’ tax revenues. Sales taxes on amusements, the
only tourism-related category broken out separately, provided an additional $7 billion of
revenue.22
In a 2005 study, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service compared more
than 300 rural counties that it defined as “recreation counties” with counties that had fewer
tourism-related activities. The researchers found that during the 1990s, the recreation counties
had three times the average population growth and twice the job growth of other rural counties.23
Additional benefits included rising land prices, less poverty, higher incomes, and more economic
diversification. Though housing rental and purchase prices rose, wages tended to rise fast enough
to compensate for the higher costs. The study found that “while other types of growth can have
similar benefits, rural recreation and tourism development may provide greater diversification,
and, for many places, it may be easier to achieve than other kinds of development—such as hightech
development—because it does not require a highly educated workforce.”24
