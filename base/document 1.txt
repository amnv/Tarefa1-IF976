Convoy of Hope is teaming up with local relief workers in Japan who have been working hard to help their communities since the earthquake and tsunami struck on March 11.

“We have made a one-year commitment to several cities in Japan where refugees are living in temporary shelters,” says Hal Donaldson, president of Convoy of Hope. “The generosity of Convoy of Hope’s partners has enabled us to be on the ground meeting needs.”

Thousands of people fled to Koriyama, a city of 340,000 in the Fukushima prefecture, where refugees are living in a large arena partitioned by cardboard boxes.

Convoy of Hope is establishing a warehouse, securing a relief vehicle and providing personnel to aid our partners based in Koriyama. Convoy of Hope is also providing kitchen sets and other household items to families who lost everything to help them begin to rebuild their lives.

A distribution center will also be established in Sendai, one of the areas hardest hit by the disaster, where the need for food, clean water and supplies is on-going.
