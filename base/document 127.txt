Estimating the Tourism Volume and Value in Parks and
Protected Areas in Canada and the USA

Visitation to the parks and protected areas of the United States of America and Canada
is an important part of the outdoor recreation industry in these countries. The social,
economic and environmental impacts of this visitation are related to its volume. This
paper contains the first ever estimation of the overall park and protected area visitation
for the Canada and the US. It contains data from all the national and provincial/state
programs, including state, provincial, and national parks and other forms of protected
areas such as wildlife refuges, national forests and national historic sites.
In 1996 there was an estimated 2,626,275,241 visitor days of recreation activity in the
parks and protected areas of Canada and the US. This use level is an underestimate, due
to structural and financial limitations within the park agencies. The associated economic
impact was calculated to be between US $236 billion and $370 billion for that year.
The US has many more protected areas, and higher levels of land area in parks, than
does Canada, even thought Canada is a slightly larger country. The recreation use
density per hectare of parkland in the US is 11 times higher than in Canada. The
visitation level per person in society is 2.4 times higher in the US than in Canada.
Reasons for these differences are suggested.
There is an urgent need for the adoption of standard approaches to the collection of park
tourism data in these two countries. The use of one such standard is proposed.
