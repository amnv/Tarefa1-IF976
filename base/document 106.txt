Early tourism

By 1915, city touring had marked significant shifts in the way Americans perceived, organized and moved around in urban environments.[6] Urban tourism became a profitable industry in 1915 as the number of tour agencies, railroad passenger departments, guidebook publishers and travel writers grew at a fast pace.[6] The expense of pleasure tours meant that only the minority of Americans between 1850 and 1915 could experience the luxury of tourism.[6] Many Americans traveled to find work, but few found time for enjoyment of the urban environment. As transportation networks improved, the length of commuting decreased, and income rose.[6] A growing number of Americans were able to afford short vacations by 1915. Still, mass tourism was not possible until after World War II.[6]

During the nineteenth century, tourism of any form had been available only to the upper and middle classes. This changed during the early twentieth century through the democratization of travel. In 1895, popular publications printed articles showing the car was cheaper to operate than the horse.[13] The development of automobiles in the early 1900s included the introduction of the Ford Model T in 1908. In 1900, 8,000 cars were registered in the US, which increased to 619,000 by 1911.[14] By the time of the Model T's introduction in 1908, there were 44 US households per car.[14] Early cars were a luxury for the wealthy, but after Ford began to dramatically drop prices after 1913, more were able to afford one.[15]

The development of hotels with leisure complexes had become a popular development during the 1930s in the United States.[16] The range of "club" type holidays available appealed to a broad segment of the holiday market.[16] As more families traveled independently by car, hotels failed to cater to their needs.[16] Kemmons Wilson opened the first motel as a new form of accommodation in Memphis, Tennessee in 1952.[16]


The Art Deco district of South Beach in Miami, Florida was developed during the 1930s.
Although thousands of tourists visited Florida during the early 1900s, it was not until after World War II that the tourist industry quickly became Florida's largest source of income.[17] Florida's white sandy beaches, warm winter temperatures and wide range of activities such as swimming, fishing, boating and hiking all attracted tourists to the state. During the 1930s, architects designed Art Deco style buildings in Miami Beach.[18] Visitors are still attracted to the Art Deco district of Miami.[18] Theme parks were soon built across Florida. One of the largest resorts in the world, Walt Disney World Resort, was opened near Orlando, Florida in 1971.[19] In its first year, the 28,000-acre (110 km2) park added $14 billion to Orlando's economy.
