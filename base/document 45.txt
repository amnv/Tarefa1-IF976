Impacts of the 26 December 2004 tsunami in Eastern Africa

Abstract
The tsunami of 26 December 2004 was the largest ever recorded in the Indian Ocean, triggered by the 3rd largest earthquake in 100 years measuring 9.2 moment magnitude. The epicenter of the earthquake was off Banda Aceh on the Indian Ocean coast of the island of Sumatra in Indonesia, centered at 3.316°N, 95.854°E. A sudden upward movement of the seafloor that averaged ∼6 m occurred along almost 1300 km of the north-east Indian Ocean plate at 0059 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and lasted 8 min. Because of the lack of preparedness and absence of warning systems in the Indian Ocean the tsunami spread silently across the ocean over a span of 8 h causing massive destruction including the deaths of over 250,000 people, with maximum damages occurring in Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, India and the Maldives. Moderate to low damages were recorded in the Seychelles, Socotra (Yemen) and Somalia, though in the latter a highly vulnerable town was impacted resulting in over 300 deaths. Most of eastern Africa was spared massive damages from the waves due to (a) distance from the epicenter (>6000 km), (b) the dissipation of energy of the tsunami by shallow banks in the middle of the Indian Ocean (the Seychelles banks, Saya de Malha and Cargados Carajos Shoals) and (c) at least for Kenya and Tanzania, the first and largest waves hit at low tide. In Kenya and Tanzania these factors resulted in the waves being experienced as tidal surges of 1–1.5 m amplitude lasting 5–10 min. Damages recorded for eastern Africa include 11 deaths in Tanzania and 1 in Kenya, of people walking and swimming over shallow intertidal flats being trapped by the advancing and receding tidal surges, damage to boats anchored in shallow water and inundation in Mauritius and Rodrigues. Official information, warning and response networks were nonexistent, and even when an official response was generated in Kenya the public demonstrated no faith or willingness to act on warnings from officials such as the police. Importantly, information on the tsunami and the generation of an official response was dependent on two technologies, satellite television and mobile telephony, and these should be built into future warning systems as key mechanisms and backups to official information and warning networks.

1. Introduction
The Indian Ocean covers some 67 million km2 and is ringed by over 22 countries with a combined human population of over 1.5 billion. It is the least well studied of the world's three largest oceans, and being ringed almost exclusively by developing countries of Africa and Asia has the lowest levels of resourcing for maritime and environmental monitoring and management. The consequences of this lack of capacity came into staggering focus on 26 December 2004 when the largest tsunami ever recorded in the Indian Ocean was triggered by the 3rd largest earthquake in 100 years (Table 1). Because of the lack of preparedness and absence of warning systems the tsunami spread silently across the ocean over a span of 8 h causing massive destruction in its wake including the deaths of over 250,000 people [1].

A great deal has been written on the origins and nature of tsunamis in general, and the recent Indian Ocean tsunami in particular [2] ;  [3]. To date one of the best-recorded tsunamis was that caused by the volcanic collapse of the island of Krakatoa in the Sunda Strait, Indonesia in 1883, which caused a tsunami of 37 m height that devastated nearby coastlines on Sumatra and Java and killed 36,417 people [4]. A tsunami is a series of large waves of extremely long wavelength (several 10 s of km) that travel over 800 km h−1 usually generated by a violent undersea disturbance such as an earthquake. In this case the earthquake near Banda Aceh on the Indian Ocean coast of the island of Sumatra in Indonesia (Fig. 1) was the 3rd largest earthquake in a century measuring 9.2 moment magnitude (Table 1). A sudden upward seafloor movement of an average of 6 m that started at 3.316°N, 95.854°E and traveled north along 1300 km of the north-east Indian Ocean plate occurred where the India plate subducts beneath the Burma plate. The earth movement was recorded at 0059 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or 0759 local time (0459 IOT; 0359 EAT; see caption to Fig. 1 for time zone abbreviations).

The human and socio-economic costs (Table 2) and suffering of southeast and south Asian countries impacted by the tsunami of 26 December 2004 (hereafter refered to as ‘the tsunami’) were as high or higher than the worst natural or manmade disasters, and perhaps because of its wide geographic reach, the worst known in recent history. Countries of eastern Africa were saved by distance from the source from impacts of the same magnitude, though the eastern tip of Somalia, Socotra Island and the Seychelles did suffer significant impacts to their populations, infrastructure and natural ecosystems [1].

For the purposes of this paper, the eastern African region is defined as coincident with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Regional Seas divisions, namely the islands of the central Indian Ocean (Seychelles, Mauritius, Reunion, Madagascar, Comoros) and the East African mainland coast (Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique), and including Socotra Island (part of Yemen, but off the western tip of the Somalia on the ‘horn of Africa’).

This paper summarizes observations from parts of eastern Africa that were not heavily impacted by the tsunami, and focuses on Kenya where observations in response to a questionnaire were recorded within a month after the tsunami by people along the coast. The reason for this is to document the experience of those parts of the Indian Ocean that suffered no or minimal damages from the tsunami, as information on impacts in more affected areas were rapidly published following rapid assessments in January–February 2005 by UNEP [1] and many publications will appear on highly impacted sites in the coming years. In the light of initiatives to develop a tsunami warning system for the Indian Ocean in UNEP [1], the paper finishes with aspects of the response and reaction to the tsunami in Kenya.

2. Methods
Summary data on the impact of the 26 December 2004 tsunami were obtained at three levels corresponding to the whole Indian Ocean, eastern Africa and Kenya. For the first, results are summarized from the UNEP Tsunami assessment report [1] which formed the first comprehensive analysis of tsunami impacts across the region. Additional information was obtained from secondary sources including media, publications and the World Wide Web. For eastern Africa, information was gleaned from media and secondary sources, some personal communications and an email request sent to key respondents known to the author. For Kenya, information was collected from the national media (Daily Nation, The Standard and The East African newspapers), personal communications during the tsunami and over subsequent days from people known to the author, and from responses to a questionnaire (Table 3) sent out by email which was then forwarded to others and was also placed in the Coastweek weekly newspaper on January 2005 and in the Malindi Museum Society Newsletter for January 2005. Because of the variety of data sources and responses, quantitative analysis is limited, but the sources provide sufficient information for a description of tsunami impacts in the low-impact countries of eastern African and in particular Kenya.
