Fewer major metropolitan areas and business destinations

Besides attracting few international visitors, the Tenth District’s lack
of very large cities and relatively large number of midsized cities may
also help explain why travel and tourism has held up better in the
region during recent recessions. According to Global Insight, travel and
tourism output in the nation’s top 100 metro areas fell 10 percent from
2000 to 2002. In contrast, the industry’s output fell just 4 percent in
the eight Tenth District metropolitan areas included on the list.20 In
general, the nation’s largest metro areas were hit harder than somewhat
smaller metro areas. Likewise, larger cities also suffered bigger declines
in hotel employment during the recession of the early 1990s.
From 2000 to 2002, travel and tourism output fell by 14 percent in
the ten largest U.S. metros and by nearly 9 percent in the next 40
largest cities (Table 2).21 In contrast, the industry’s output in the
remainder of Global Insight’s Top 100 metros—roughly those with
populations between 500,000 and 1.2 million—fell by less than 4
percent during that time (and by just 1.4 percent if Honolulu is
excluded from this group). Global Insight attributes the larger declines
in the bigger cities to several factors, including these cities’ larger
reliance on international travel, business travel, and air travel in
general—all of which have been in a slump since early 2001. In addition,
terrorism-related fears may have recently kept some leisure
travelers away from larger cities. 
As in 2001 and 2002, the nation’s largest cities also suffered a larger
downturn in travel and tourism activity than the rest of the country
during the recession of the early 1990s. The district’s relative lack of
very large cities and major business destinations likely helps explain its
travel and tourism sector’s better performance during this period as
well. Although travel and tourism output data for metropolitan areas
are not available for the early 1990s, data on hotel employment are
available for most major U.S. cities.
