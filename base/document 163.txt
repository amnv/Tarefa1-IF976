'Trump slump' could hurt US tourism industry as interest in travel 'falls off a cliff'

Travel website Kayak said interest in the USA had "fallen off a cliff" since Mr Trump's inauguration and sweeping travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority nations.

Searches for US destinations have fallen dramatically and hotel prices in Las Vegas, Los Angeles and New York City have dropped more than anywhere else globally.

Dreams of better life crushed


Syrian refugee Ammar Sawan describes Donald Trump's entry ban as a bolt of lightning in which his "hopes and dreams vanished".
A drop in travel to the US would hit the country hard in the hip pocket — in New York City alone, the travel industry is worth $US60 billion ($AU78 billion) annually.

UK-based Kayak found searches for flights to some of the most popular destinations in Florida had dropped since last year — by 58 per cent to Tampa, 58 per cent to Orlando, 57 per cent to Fort Lauderdale and 52 per cent to Miami.

And the news was no better on the other side of the country, where searches for San Diego were down 43 per cent, searches for Las Vegas down 36 per cent and searches for Los Angeles down 32 per cent.

Although flight prices have so far remained steady, hotel prices also dropped, with average prices down in Las Vegas by 39 per cent, in San Francisco by 34 per cent, and in New York by 32 per cent.
