French Polynesia on alert after Chile quake

Sirens wailed in French Polynesia and PA systems woke up residents on Saturday as a tsunami raced across the Pacific following a massive earthquake in Chile.

The high commissioner's office in Papeete put the islands on alert at 2am (11pm AEDT), saying the first waves were expected to reach the Gambier archipelago at 5.50am on Saturday (2.50am AEDT Sunday).

The other parts of the region, including Tahiti and Bora Bora, would be affected over the following two to three hours, they said.

In Tahiti, which was expected to be hit at 7.50am on Saturday (4.50am AEDT Sunday), all traffic was banned within 500 metres of the coast.

The tsunami could be as high as two metres in the Marquise islands and on Rurutu in the Australes, the authorities said, while warning people in the latter places to climb to at least 10 metres above sea level.

The high commissioner's office warned that a tsunami comes in several waves of which the first may not be the highest.

A huge arc of Pacific nations from New Zealand to Japan went on tsunami alert following the 8.8 magnitude Chilean earthquake, readying emergency plans instituted after the Indian Ocean disaster of 2004.
