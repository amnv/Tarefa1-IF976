U.S. Trade in Tourism 

Tourism exports are the amount of money that foreign visitors spend in the United States on
passenger fares and travel-related goods and services such as food, lodging, recreation, gifts,
entertainment, and local transportation, including travel to and from the United States aboard a
U.S. airline. Spending by foreign visitors is watched closely by the industry because overseas
visitors tend to take longer trips than domestic tourists and to spend more per day.28 Tourism
imports are corresponding expenditures by U.S. residents traveling abroad, including fares paid to
foreign air carriers on flights to and from the United States. 
U.S. tourism exports totaled $180.7 billion in 2013, making tourism the United States’ singlelargest
services sector export,29 and accounted for 8% of all U.S. goods and services exports in
2012.30 As shown in Figure 3, tourism exports have grown strongly over the past decade, except
in 2009, when they plunged 15% from the previous year due to poor economic conditions in
Europe and elsewhere.31
In 2013, an estimated 61.6 million U.S. residents traveled outside the United States, an increase
of 1.5% from 2012. Mexico and Canada account for more than half of all outbound travel.32
Between 2003 and 2013, the U.S. trade surplus in travel and tourism services grew more than
thirtyfold to $57 billion, even as the nation’s overall merchandise trade deficit increased 30% to
$703 billion.33 Every year since 1989, travel and tourism have posted a trade surplus. 
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, foreign visitors account for a disproportionate
amount of U.S. travel and tourism spending. Foreigners are estimated to have accounted for 20%
of spending on lodging, 20% of food and beverage demand, and 27% of total passenger air
transportation demand in 2011.36 A likely explanation is that foreigners spend, on average, far
more on their U.S. travels than Americans do. U.S. Travel estimates that in 2011, for example, the
average Chinese visitor spent $7,107 and the average Brazilian tourist $5,605.37 Visitors from the
European Union accounted for a quarter of total visitor receipts in the United States in 2012 (see
Table 4).38 Although receipts from emerging market visitors are much lower, they have grown
quickly since 2007
