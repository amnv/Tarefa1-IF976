Increased Visitation from Emerging Markets 

Visitation and spending from Brazil, China and India have continued to increase, supported by
steps outlined in the President’s Executive Order and the Strategy.
To address the important economic opportunity presented by booming tourist travel from the
developing world, the Department of State created over 50 new officer positions in China in
fiscal year 2012 and more than doubled Mission Brazil’s consular staff. Ahead of schedule, the
State Department met the President’s Executive Order target of a 40% capacity increase in Brazil
and China. In addition, the Department piloted a rapid-hiring program to deploy 59 more
adjudicators in China, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, and the Dominican Republic, an added
capacity of 900,000 visas adjudications per year.
The State Department continues to increase capacity by expanding and remodeling consular
facilities to process more visa applications, including planned expansions in China and India and
entirely new visa-processing facilities in Porto Alegre and Belo Horizonte, Brazil, and Wuhan,
China.
