The Trade Surplus That Trump Is About to Kill

he United States wants to host the 2026 World Cup, and if implemented, President Trump’s travel ban could dash our odds of doing so. “If players cannot come because of political decisions, or populist decisions, then the World Cup cannot be played there,” Aleksander Ceferin, a top European soccer official, told the New York Times this week. “It is true for the United States, but also for all the other countries that would like to organize a World Cup.”

Talk about an own goal. Hosting the 2026 World Cup would be an economic plus for the United States. We wouldn’t have to build a bunch of new stadiums: Thanks to growth in the sport since 1994, the last time the U.S. hosted the World Cup, there are a few dozen arenas capable of handling big games. And with the format of the tournament expanding from 32 to 48 teams, it would be a huge boon to tourism. In 2014, more than 1 million foreign visitors went to Brazil for the World Cup. Many more than that would attend a World Cup in the U.S. And every penny they spend, in addition to stimulating the economy, would cut the trade deficit.

We rarely think of tourism as something related to U.S. trade, but we should: Inbound tourism to the U.S. is an export—and outbound tourism from the U.S. is an import. And right now, the policies of the Trump administration are threatening to throw that particular trade balance seriously out of whack.

We Americans are generally a provincial people. There were about 132 million valid U.S. passports in circulation last year—meaning only about 40 percent of U.S. residents have them. And the country is so large and varied that there is plenty to see without having to leave. I’m 49 and have traveled a ton, yet still have not been to nine states.
